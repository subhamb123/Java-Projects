The files in this repository are all the java projects I have been working on. The 'Final Project' folder basically is a copy of all of the other projects in this repository. Why it seems like a duplicate is because there is an additional project called 'Magpie.java'. This is a chatbot and one of its additional funtions is to pull any project I have worked on that the user desires. This way, all projects can be viewed in one run. This only works if I create a duplicate of each project and store them in the same folder where 'Magpie.java' is. 

Thus, if you want to view all of my projects in a fun way, I suggest you to download all of the files in the 'Final Project' folder and run 'Magpie.java'. This way, you can chat with my chatbot and view my other projects. If you want to see an individual project on its own, check out the 'Projects' folder. 

The 'Boggle' and 'Critter' folders are each a separate project too. Check them out!

And one more thing, you might be confused where to actually get the java projects. It is under every parent folder's 'src' folder.
