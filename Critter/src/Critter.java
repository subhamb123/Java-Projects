// The Critter interface defines the methods necessary for an animal

// character when getChar is called that is used for displaying it on
// the screen.  The getMove method must return a legal move (one of
// the constants NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, CENTER).  See the
// CritterInfo interface for a description of its methods.
